## Overview

Welcome to RapidRank Search! This project is all about efficiently sorting and retrieving elements. I designed this to tackle finding the "kth" largest or smallest elements quickly using a custom heap structure. My main goal here was to build a streamlined algorithm that can handle large datasets without slowing down, perfect for scenarios where ranking or prioritizing data is key.

## Features
* **Optimized Ranking**: Uses a heap-based system to quickly retrieve top-ranked elements without sorting everything.
* **Flexible Searches**: Allows easy switching between finding the largest or smallest elements based on whatâ€™s needed.
* **Performance-Focused Design**: Efficient memory and time handling, making it capable of handling larger data inputs smoothly.
